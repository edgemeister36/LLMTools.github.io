# LLM Tools README

This repository contains the code and instructions for the LLM assignment. The assignment involves using different Language Model tools (LLMs) to fix errors in generated code, hosting the fixed code on GitHub Pages, and evaluating the accessibility of the hosted websites using Wave and A Checker tools.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is divided into the following steps:

1. **Generating Code**: Use different prompts to generate code snippets from various LLM tools.
2. **Uploading to GitHub**: Upload the generated code to a GitHub repository.
3. **Hosting on GitHub Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages for the repository to host the website.
4. **Evaluating Accessibility**: Use Wave and A Checker tools to evaluate the accessibility of the hosted website.
5. **Fixing Errors**: Use the respective LLM tools to fix any accessibility errors detected by Wave and A Checker.
6. **Repeating Steps 2-5**: Repeat the process of uploading, hosting, evaluating, and fixing until the website is fully accessible.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Code**: Contains the generated code snippets from LLM tools.
- **Error_Fixing_Sheet**: Contains a spreadsheet documenting the errors detected and fixed during the assignment.

## Instructions for Deploying Websites

To deploy each website:

1. Go to the repository's Settings.
2. Navigate to the Pages section.
3. Under the Source section, choose the branch containing the fixed code (depending on the LLM tool used).
4. Click on the "Deploy from..." button and select the appropriate branch.
5. Wait for approximately 10 minutes for the webpage to update.
6. Once deployed, obtain the website link from the Pages section of the repository's Settings.

## Note

GitHub Copilot was not used as it requires a subscription. 
The default branch (main) uses ChatGPT as its LLM tool.
